# TicTacToe

So, I got some free time and decided to test out the capabilities of AI.
ChatGPT wrote almost all of this code, along with GitHub Copilot.
I simply steered the boat and almost got something really cool and functional.

The CLI game is really simple and works most of the time.
The GUI game well, I tried to implement an AI to go against you but, it didnt work out that well.

This is simply a test of the possibilities of AI and I did it in like 40 minutes.
